            <b> Purposes of processing </b>

            We may use and transfer the personal data we collect for the following purpose:
            <ul>
                <li>to identify, register and make further personalization of the communication between you, as a user, and us, as a data controller, providing access to the services for users;</li>
                <li>to provide WISE WIN LTD Services to you and your company, including the discharge of obligations of WISE WIN LTD to you and to financial or other institutions in connection with WISE WIN LTD Services provided to you (and (or) to your company).

                <li>to improve and develop our business, including, without limitation, improvement of our websites or portals, products and services. The above may include the use of information that you specify in the forms but do not communicate to us, for example, the use of such information to improve our website(s) and communication with you as part of support provision in respect of such form. We may also use your personal data to develop and test new products and services.</li>
                <li>to manage and exercise our rights, comply with the terms of use and any other contracts with you (and (or) with you company), including to manage any circumstances arising in connection with the challenging of transactions, fees or bonus points; to manage, investigate and regulate claims; to repay debts; or in case of your insolvency;</li>

If you apply for the use of one of our financial products we evaluate your financial standing (and (or) financial standing of your entity) to the extent provided for in the applicable Terms of Use. Such verification of credit standing will also engage any related parties, such as directors, shareholders and managers. We may perform such actions by way of receiving and exchanging information with credit bureaus and fraud preventing agencies. Verification of credit standing will also engage any person sharing an account with you or having similar financial connection. If an application is a joint application and such connection exists no longer, it may be created. Such connections continue until you send a "separation notice" to credit rating agencies. Please note that the agencies record our requests, which may be viewed by other companies making their own credit requests; a "trace" may be left in your credit file, regardless of whether you have become a client or not. If you are a director, we will request credit bureaus to certify that the residential address you specified coincides with the address recorded in the company registers (if necessary). In addition to the above, during the provision of services, we provide information on your account maintenance to credit bureaus. If you do not repay your credits fully and on time, credit bureaus register the outstanding debt and may deliver such information to other entities carrying out similar checks. Such agencies keep these records for 6 years, regardless of the fact of discharge of your obligations. Please contact us for additional information on the use of credit bureau services by us</li>

WISE WIN LTD takes part in the initiatives aimed to combat fraud, which imply the assessment of you (and your clients) and monitoring of your transactions and (or) position location, to identify schemes requiring investigation, or to model and evaluate the possibility of fraudulent actions. Such tasks can be completed due to the use of third-party products and services. Besides, if you provide false or unreliable data on yourself, or if we identify or suspect commission of fraud or breach, we may deliver such information to fraud preventing agencies and law-enforcement authorities and we may choose to file a suit;</li>
                <li>to avoid or reduce the risk of information safety;</li>
                <li>to deliver marketing messages in order to communicate to you information on the products and services that you requested or that, in our opinion, could be of interest to you; to get your feedback on our products, services and websites; as it pertains to marketing, marketing research and similar activities, we may use your personal data for such purposes, regardless of whether you have become our client or continue to receive WISE WIN LTD Services.</li>

            </h1>
            <p>
            You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information in certain circumstances. This is your so called ‘right to be forgotten’. If you want to exercise this right of yours contact us via our contact form https://wise.win/contact and let us know what you want to be erased.

            This right is not absolute so make sure your case follows under one of the following circumstances:

            · we do not need your data anymore (example: you do not work for one of our Partners anymore);

            · you initially consented to the use of your data, but have now withdrawn your consent (have in mind that this applies only to the personal data we process on the ground of your consent);

            · you have objected to the use of your data, and your interests outweigh ours;

            · we have a legal obligation to erase your data;

            · you suspect we have used your data unlawfully.

            If your request meets one of the above scenarios we will erase your data. We can refuse to erase your data on one of the grounds in Article 17(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation, namely if your data is necessary for reasons of:

            · freedom of expression and information;

            · legal obligation to keep your data;

            · public health;

            · establishing, exercising or defending legal claims;

            · when erasing your data would prejudice scientific or historical research or archiving that is in the public interest.

            If your request is justified, we are going to erase your data in the one-month term specified in Article 12(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

            If you are unhappy with the result, please first get back to us so that we can investigate the matter further.

            If you want to exercise this right of yours contact us via our contact form https://wise.win/contact and let us know what data you want consider incorrect and how you want it to be amended.

            When we receive your request, we are going to investigate the issue and either correct it or inform you why we consider the data accurate. We can also refuse on the ground of your request being “manifestly unfounded or excessive” which means it will cost us a significant amount of money or it will take a vast amount of resources.

            If your request is justified, we are going to rectify your data in the one-month term specified in Article 12(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

Responsibility for safety and protection of your information also rests with you. If we have given you (or if you created) a password or access code to access certain sections of our website or portal or mobile applications, etc., you shall be responsible for the non-disclosure of such password and (or) access code.

            Information transfer via the Internet is not completely safe. Despite our attempts to protect your personal data, we may not guarantee the safety of information transmitted to our website, except when you communicate with us via a protected channel provided by us.

            Your personal data retention period

            The period of retention of your personal data depends on its nature and type, WISE WIN LTD Services and the country, in which they are provided, as well as on any applicable regulatory requirements and provisions of local legislation. As a rule, if such data is not needed any longer it is to be destroyed or depersonalized or aggregated with other data.

Upon termination of relationship, we are to store certain personal data within the period provided for by legislative and regulatory requirements of your home country. For instance, we store your personal data within the period prescribed by local legislation for filing a statement of claim (so called "action limitation period") or within the period prescribed by a court ruling, law-enforcement authorities or our regulators.

            We may continue with our marketing emailing if it does not run contrary to the local legislation and in the absence of your refusal to receive such mails.

            Automatic decision-making

            In some cases, our use of your personal data may lead to automatic decision-making (including evaluation), which may have a significant legal or other impact on you. Automatic decision-making means that a decision in your respect is taken automatically and is based on computer definition (using software algorithms) without human input. For instance, we use automatic decisions to evaluate your credit capacity when you apply for certain Services provided by WISE WIN LTD, or to perform audits aimed to prevent fraud as described in What Do We Use Your Personal Data For? section. We have taken measures to ensure protection of rights and interests of those persons whose personal data is used for automatic decision-making.

You may exercise this right by contacting us at the details specified below.
